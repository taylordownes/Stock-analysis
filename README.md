# Stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project was to generate, edit, and refactor VBA script for the Green Stocks dataset that helped us determine how well stocks performed in the past. Our goal was to generate a macro that looped through the data set by the click of a button to compare the stock tickers to their respective totaly daily volume and return rates. To acheive this, we used a combination of loops, If statements, static and conditional formatting, and more to generate a clean report for analysis.
