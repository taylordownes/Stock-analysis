# Stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project was to generate, edit, and refactor VBA script for the Green Stocks dataset that helped us determine how well stocks performed in the past. Our goal was to generate a macro that looped through the data set by the click of a button to compare the stock tickers to their respective totaly daily volume and return rates. To acheive this, we used a combination of loops, If statements, static and conditional formatting, and more to generate a clean report for analysis.  
### Analysis and Challenges
Our project was based on helping "Steve" create an analysis for his parents to determine how well Daquo Energy Corporation (DQ) performed in the past before they decided to invest their money. Aside from helping Steve with an analysis solely for DQ, we also created an analysis that compared other green energy corporations to DQ to get a better understanding of how well DQ stock performed. 
The series of procedures were as followed:
- Used the green stocks data to generate a report for DQ that calculated the yearly return for DQ in 2018 on the DQ Analysis tab in the Green_Stocks.xlsm file.
- Created an analysis for all stocks to see if different stocks performed better than DQ on the All Stocks Analysis tab in the Green_Stocks.xlsm file.
- Created buttons to run and clear the code we wrote for the analysis.
- **Refactored the code in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm file to make the code more readable and efficient.**
